# Milestone 1 - Add with Print

### You are generating code only for the .expand files, and integrating them
with a larger program

To compile the source, do:

```shell
make 
```
This builds a library that you are free to add functions to.
It also builds the addwithprint binary, and links it with the library.

You'll want to change the CSRCS variable in the Makefile to your assembly 
(.s) file.
